# TL Studio architecture

## Product boundary

TL Studio is a local-first application with one mandatory Go product process plus embedded Browser assets.

The Go launcher owns the workspace, filesystem, Search, process/Terminal execution, Preview, provider registry, credential management, direct model clients, Native Agent, sessions, questions, permissions, events, Tool Registry, Tool Executor, Plugins/MCP, and Provider Account adapters.

Explicit integrations may use an optional provider-owned helper process when that is the provider's documented third-party surface. ChatGPT uses the official OpenAI Codex CLI/App Server and Claude account access uses the official Anthropic Claude Code CLI. These helpers provide authentication/model transport only; TL Studio retains ownership of Sessions, permissions, tools, persistence, project mutations, and the outer Agent loop.

## Startup

Normal startup initializes TL Studio services, starts the loopback local server, and opens the Browser UI.

Provider helper processes are lazy and optional; they start only when their integration is used.

## Browser boundary

The Browser uses TL Studio-owned semantic APIs on the same local control origin. Core paths include /local/status, /local/health, /local/providers, /local/provider-accounts, /local/sessions, /local/questions, /local/permissions, /local/events, /local/plugins, and /local/tools.

Browser source is TypeScript under cmd/launcher/ui. browser.ts is the ordered entry point and esbuild creates the embedded Browser bundle. Generated JavaScript is not tracked. Monaco is bundled locally.

## Native Agent

The execution path is:

Browser
→ local Session run
→ TL Studio Session domain
→ Native Agent
→ selected Provider
→ model response
→ TL Studio Tool Executor when requested
→ Provider continuation
→ semantic transcript and final answer

The runtime resolves only providers and models that TL Studio can execute directly. Unsupported protocols or capabilities produce explicit errors instead of being routed to another engine.

## Sessions

All active sessions are TL Studio sessions. The Session domain owns IDs, create/rename/delete, run/abort, status, messages, activity and usage, file changes, and persistence.

## Interactive questions

Interactive questions are native Agent semantics:

Native Agent
→ interaction.question
→ Question Manager
→ /local/questions
→ Browser
→ reply or reject
→ Question Manager
→ Agent resumes

Questions are scoped by session. Multiple choice, multiple selection, custom text, rejection, and context cancellation are supported. Pending/resolved changes emit semantic attention.changed events.

## Permissions

The Permission Engine is authoritative for native tool execution. It owns pending requests, allow-once and reject decisions, project-scoped remembered allow rules, sensitive-action restrictions, policy matching, enforcement, and semantic attention events.

The Browser uses only /local/permissions*.

## Events

The local Event Bus is the single semantic event source:

Native Agent / Tool / Session / Question / Permission / Workspace
→ TL Studio Event Bus
→ /local/events
→ Browser

The SSE stream is a responsiveness signal. Persisted semantic session data remains transcript authority.

## Providers and credentials

The provider registry is authoritative for model connection definitions and model catalogs.

Supported direct model protocols currently include OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Google Gemini generateContent. ChatGPT-plan access uses `codex-chatgpt`; Claude.ai subscription access uses the separate `claude-code-account` provider bridge described below.

Manual API credentials and account credentials managed by TL Studio are stored separately in the TL Studio credential vault and do not appear in providers.json or Browser storage. A connected account may temporarily take precedence without overwriting the user's manual API key.

For ChatGPT, OpenAI's official Codex client owns the OAuth token persistence and refresh lifecycle inside an isolated TL Studio-specific `CODEX_HOME`. For Claude.ai account login, the official Claude Code client owns the subscription credential inside a TL Studio-specific `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. TL Studio does not read, copy, serialize, or expose either provider's raw OAuth credential.

Unsupported models remain explicit unsupported capabilities.

JEV has two intentionally separate integration paths. The legacy JEV Router provider uses OpenRouter and remains a provider/model transport. JEV Direct is a global Router plugin that calls TypeSafe's documented System One API directly with a TypeSafe API key from the TL Studio credential vault. JEV Direct sends only the routing state and typed routing questions to TypeSafe, receives a structured decision, and then selects from TL Studio's already-connected native Agent models. It does not proxy the final model request and does not own tools, permissions, files, Terminal, Sessions, retries, or the Agent loop.

## Provider Account domain

ProviderAccountAdapter and /local/provider-accounts* define the generic account-backed integration boundary. The lifecycle covers typed login challenges, polling/completion, cancellation, refresh, status, model discovery, and logout. An optional Provider Account setup contract exposes only non-secret configuration fields through /local/provider-accounts/{id}/setup.

Browser code receives only semantic account state and safe login instructions. OAuth authorization codes, PKCE verifiers, access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, cookies, and client secrets never enter Browser state. Provider credentials are either stored in the TL Studio credential vault or owned by the provider's official isolated client store for ChatGPT/Codex and Claude Code.

The Provider Settings UI does not equate "no account OAuth" with "unavailable". Claude is a hybrid branded card: `claude` remains the manual Anthropic API provider while account-backed usage is represented separately by `claude-account`. This prevents an account sign-in from overwriting or intercepting the user's manual API-key provider. Google/Gemini, Hugging Face, and OpenRouter continue to use API-credential presets; ChatGPT/Codex uses account sign-in; GitHub Copilot remains a reserved deferred account slot.

OpenRouter is the first concrete account adapter in the 0.6 development line. It uses OpenRouter's documented OAuth + PKCE flow, exchanges the authorization code server-side for a user-controlled OpenRouter key, stores that key in the account credential slot, discovers models through the normal provider discovery path, and then uses the existing Native Agent/provider execution path.

Hugging Face is the second concrete account adapter. TL Studio identifies itself as a public native OAuth client through a CIMD document hosted at https://pouramin.dev/.well-known/oauth-cimd, uses Authorization Code + PKCE with a loopback callback, stores access and refresh tokens only in the account vault slot, refreshes expiring tokens inside the Provider Account adapter, and syncs the official Inference Providers model catalog into the existing Provider Registry. The Native Agent resolves a fresh account credential through the adapter without containing Hugging Face-specific authentication logic.

Google/Gemini is implemented as an installed-app OAuth adapter using Authorization Code + PKCE, refresh tokens, and token revocation. Each login starts a temporary HTTP listener bound only to 127.0.0.1 on a random port and uses the bare loopback origin as redirect_uri, matching Google's documented desktop-app loopback pattern; the listener validates OAuth state and shuts down after completion, cancellation, or expiry. Gemini model calls use the native generateContent transport and keep Google-specific thought-signature continuation state inside the model protocol boundary. The non-secret Google Cloud Project ID is sent as x-goog-user-project for quota/billing and is persisted in local account setup (and the account-managed provider definition after discovery); OAuth tokens remain only in the credential vault. During the 0.6 alpha the Desktop OAuth Client ID can also be supplied through the non-secret setup surface until a production TL Studio OAuth client is registered and shipped.

ChatGPT/Codex is implemented through OpenAI's documented Codex App Server and CLI surface. Account login uses Codex-managed ChatGPT OAuth; TL Studio opens the returned authorization URL, observes the official login-completed notification, reads semantic account metadata, and synchronizes `model/list` into an account-managed Provider definition. The official Codex authentication store is isolated under TL Studio's own `CODEX_HOME`.

For ChatGPT-plan model turns, `codex-chatgpt` reuses an official Codex App Server and creates an ephemeral structured thread with a read-only sandbox, approval policy `never`, web search disabled, and Codex built-in tool paths disabled. TL Studio supplies only the current model-turn conversation plus TL Studio Tool schemas and then executes any requested Tools through its own Tool Executor and Permission Engine.

Claude.ai subscription access uses Anthropic's official Claude Code account commands for browser login, semantic status, and logout. Claude Code runs with a TL Studio-specific `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, while inherited API-key, alternate bearer-token, Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, profile, and OAuth-token environment sources are removed from the account helper environment so account mode cannot silently switch to another billing/auth source.

For account-backed Claude model turns, `claude-code-account` invokes the official non-interactive Claude Code surface with `--safe-mode`, no session persistence, built-in tools disabled, MCP tools denied, Chrome disabled, strict empty MCP configuration, and required structured JSON output. It runs from an empty temporary directory. The only model-facing tools are the TL Studio Tool schemas embedded in the structured bridge prompt; actual Tool execution and permissions remain TL Studio-owned. The account runtime provider `claude-account` is intentionally separate from the manual API provider `claude`.

Claude Web is a separate browser-session transport for users who want TL Studio to consume the quota of the Claude Web account already signed in to their normal Chrome profile without Anthropic API billing or Claude Code. The Chrome extension is deliberately an inference-only transport. The TL Studio localhost UI pairs to it with an ephemeral random token and relays exactly two backend command kinds: `probe` and `complete`. The extension has no TL Studio file, Terminal, Permission, Session, Plugin, or Tool endpoint authority.

Claude requests run in the main-world context of `https://claude.ai/` through `chrome.scripting.executeScript` and page-context `fetch(..., {credentials: "include"})`. Chrome therefore keeps the authenticated web session browser-owned: TL Studio and the extension do not read, decrypt, export, serialize, or store Claude cookies or `sessionKey` values. The extension first reuses an already-open Claude tab. If none exists, it creates one inactive pinned transport tab and reuses that same tab for the whole bridge session instead of creating one tab per model turn. On explicit TL Studio sign-out, only an extension-owned transport tab is closed; a user-owned Claude tab is never closed. No separate Chrome profile, cloned profile, DevTools/CDP runtime, UI Automation, clipboard/keystroke automation, or separate Claude login window is part of this transport. Direct service-worker fetches are not used for Claude inference because Claude Web rejects the extension origin; authenticated inference therefore stays inside the real Claude page origin.

The provider boundary is an architectural invariant: no provider may own or execute the TL Studio Agent loop. Claude Web returns inference text or structured Tool proposals only. TL Studio remains authoritative for Context construction, Agent lifecycle, Tool execution, Permission decisions, project/filesystem access, Terminal, Plugins, Sessions, persistence, retry/recovery, and every model → Tool → model continuation. Removing the Claude Web transport must therefore remove only that inference capability, not any TL Studio Agent capability. The account-managed runtime model is `claude-sonnet-5-5` / `Claude Sonnet 5.5 (Web)`.

These provider bridges are deliberately provider-specific rather than replacement Agent runtimes: TL Studio remains authoritative for Session lifecycle, Tool execution, permissions, project mutations, persistence, and semantic events. If the official executables are not on PATH, the alpha can use `npx @openai/codex` and `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code`; Provider Settings also accepts explicit executable paths.

Account providers whose authentication or model-transport contract does not currently fit this product boundary remain visible as explicit unavailable adapters rather than disappearing from Settings. GitHub Copilot is the remaining deferred account boundary while its documented model integration requires the Copilot SDK/runtime.

Private or undocumented provider OAuth flows are not reverse-engineered. Deferred boundary adapters are never registered as runtime credential sources.

## Tools and Plugins/MCP

The Native Tool Executor resolves TL Studio Tool Registry descriptors and enforces project boundaries and permissions before execution.

Core tools cover workspace files, Search, and process execution. Plugins/MCP can contribute tools through the same Agent-facing execution model.

Curated Graphify is installed globally as a reusable executable integration, while its generated graph remains project-local under `graphify-out`. Switching projects restarts global MCP clients in the active project working directory; a project without a graph reports Graph Missing and can build its own graph without reinstalling Graphify.

Router plugins are a separate plugin capability from MCP tools. They can influence model selection but never enter the Tool Registry. Laya is a local MCP-backed decision router; JEV Direct is a remote TypeSafe System One decision router. Both ultimately hand a selected native model back to the same TL Studio Agent runtime.

## Terminal and Preview

Processes are project-scoped. Command stop terminates process trees where supported. The current Terminal foundation is a command runner rather than a full PTY.

Preview is isolated from the TL Studio control origin and accepts loopback Preview URLs only.

## Security boundaries

The control UI binds to loopback. Non-loopback Host values are rejected and Browser Origin must match the local control origin.

Filesystem APIs are project-boundary checked. Traversal and symlink escapes are rejected. External providers, repositories, prompts, and MCP/plugin processes are untrusted inputs.

## Release architecture

A normal package contains tl-studio or tl-studio.exe, TL Studio licenses/notices, bundled TL Studio plugins where configured, and the Claude Web extension source/package when that integration is enabled. It does not contain a coding-runtime sidecar. Consumer Chrome distribution of the extension is expected to use the Chrome Web Store; review packages may include the unpacked extension directory for manual validation before store publication.

CI validates review and release package contents before publication.

## Regression proof

CI is expected to prove:

1. Browser strict TypeScript/build succeeds.
2. Go tests and vet succeed.
3. Supported platform cross-compiles succeed.
4. Standalone TL Studio starts normally with no sidecar.
5. Native Session lifecycle works.
6. Fake Provider → Native Agent → native tool → filesystem → Provider continuation → final answer works.
7. Native Agent question → pending question → answer → resumed Agent works.
8. Native permissions and remembered rules work.
9. Real Browser smoke succeeds.
10. Provider registry, credentials, and catalog work without another runtime.
11. Windows review and release packages pass package-content validation.
12. Production Browser source and workflows use the intended TL Studio product contracts.
